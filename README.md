### ‚ùì Why Lua

1. **Easy to learn**: Lua is a **lightweight, simple yet powerful** scripting language. Even beginners can quickly get started with it.
2. **Efficient**: With Luagin, you **don't need** to build and manage **complex projects**, write **extensive boilerplate code**, or navigate through **hard-to-read APIs**, like you would when developing Java plugins.
3. **Hot update**: **Reloading** scripts takes effect immediately, greatly improving the development experience and reducing the cost of trial and error.
4. **Security**: Lua scripts run in a **controlled environment**, making it highly unlikely for them to crash the server or cause other serious issues.
5. **FFI Library**: Through LuaJIT's FFI library, you can directly interact with C, and **perform underlying system operations**.

## üìö Documents

https://ezeny.gitbook.io/luagin-docs

    Due to insufficient time, the document currently only contains necessary
    information, which means you need to search for relevant information about
    some classes and their methods in Bukkit's documentation.

## üß™ Compatibility

- The supported game versions depend on the **server-side API**.
- The support for `Bukkit` and its branches depends on the compatibility between the `Spigot` API and them. (**currently almost compatible**)
